VESC - cost sensitive solution

Playing with electronic speed controllers can be really enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. I have always had a hard time using custom ESC’s when everything seems to work well and in the next second some tangled wire, or ESD charge kills an important chip or even one crucial I/O pin spoiling all the fun.

Most of the time I am working with a VESC controller thanks to the fact that it is open source (in hardware and software) and very popular. Assembled, it costs around 70-100$ so burning it once or twice can discourage further work.

I was facing that problem for a long time, finally it seems that I found a way out and I want to share it with you. The idea is to assemble controllers on your own. Whole process includes ordering pcbs and parts (also a couple which are the most fault prone) and assembling them by hand (it is easier that it seems). After that we can get 3 pieces of controller with spare parts in the price of one assembled to go VESC. If you are interested, I invite you to read further.


`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
