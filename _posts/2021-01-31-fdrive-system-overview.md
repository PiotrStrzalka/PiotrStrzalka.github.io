# F-drive e-bike conversion system
{:.no_toc}
The idea to create friction drive system has been born in my head a couple of years ago. I wanted to check how it is to ride an electric bike, but back then I did not have access to any. Upgrading my bike to be fully electric was not an option since I wanted to keep it as untouched as possible.

Then I found a friction drive solution and after some doubts about efficiency I started to create my own version of it. And here we are a couple of years later.. with almost finished system.

# How it works
The principle of a friction drive relies on pressing down roll to the tire to pass the drive. To simplify the system a little instead of roller (which supposly is powered by some tension  belt) we can use brushless outrunner motor where rotator can act as a roller.

Disadvantages of it are obvious: less efficient use of energy, faster tire wear and problem with wet conditions. But before reject the idea completely advantages also need to be listed: 
- little modification in existing bike
