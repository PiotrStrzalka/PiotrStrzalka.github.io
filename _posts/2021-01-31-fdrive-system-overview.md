# F-drive e-bike conversion system
{:.no_toc}
The idea to create friction drive system has been born in my head a couple of years ago. I wanted to check how it is to ride an electric bike, but back then I did not have access to any. Upgrading my bike to be fully electric was not an option since I wanted to keep it as untouched as possible.

Then I found a friction drive solution and after some doubts about efficiency I started to create my own version of it. And here we are a couple of years later.. with almost finished system.

# How it works
The principle of a friction drive relies on pressing down roll to the tire to pass the drive. To simplify the system a little instead of a roller (which supposedly is powered by some tension belt) we can use a brushless outrunner motor where the rotator can act as a roller.


In this friction drive implementation to connect and hold motor attached to the tire is used torque produced by rotor. To make this solution works flawlessly a lot of tries and iterations were required (both in mounting arm design and software adjustments), but I am more than happy with final result.

Comparing to traditional e-bike systems disadvantages of fdrive are obvious: less efficient use of energy, faster tire wear and a problem with wet conditions. But before reject the idea advantages also need to be listed: 
- **little modification in bike**
- **fast and simple mount and dismount**
- **no motor resistance during normal biking** (motor then is completely disconnected from tire)

## Controller
That part took huge amount of time:


| Controller                        | Prons         | Cons  | Price |
