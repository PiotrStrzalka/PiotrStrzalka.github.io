# Custom Pedal Assist Sensor (PAS) + VESC support 
{:.no_toc}

Pedal Assist Sensor (PAS) - is a device that can be mount on the crank of a bicycle which gives you information about the current movement of pedals. (**[On ebikes.ca](https://ebikes.ca/learn/pedal-assist.html)** you can find a broader description of these sensors.

Normally sensor have three wires and can track effectively movement, but detection if it is movement in right direction can be a little tricky. Therefore, due to the fact that I have 3D printer and I know a little about electronics I made my own version of PAS.

# Pedal Assist Sensor - market standard


I got a bunch of Varied width sensors which requires one wire to connect to uC. The signal that can be read looks like below:

Distinction between forward and backward movement can be done based on Tu/Td ratio (ratio between time where signal is on high and low position). Even when I am reading previous sentence I see that measurement is going to be lame. And it really is, I tried to improve it with some filtering, state detection etc. but results didn't satisfys me at all. **[My attempt can be seen on github repo.](https://github.com/strzaleczka/bldc/blob/friction_drive/applications/app_pas_sensor.c)**

# Pedal Assist Sensor - my own version

**[My fdrive application](/2021/01/24/fdrive-application.html)** requires to have proper distinction between forward and backward movement and also reliable information about full backward rotation. Knowing that I decided to implement sensing in "encoder like" manner, that means at output I will get two signals (called A and B) crossing themselfs dirrefently according to direction, check following picture for details.

## Mechanical design

What I really don't like about stock sensor is fact that you need to remove crank to mount it on the bike. Avoiding that was the most crucial requirement. Earlier electronic tests when I checked signal quality gave me information that putting 12 magnets around the perimeter gives the best results. Knows all of that I turned on Fusion 360 and after a couple of iterations I got something that is quite useful.

## Electronic circuit

Ealier I though that Hall sensors are simple, just buy a random one connect power supply and it's ready. But I disregarded my oponent, there are many parameters (unipolar, bipolar, latching ...) and sensitivity levels and usage combinations, I was overhelmed for a little. Then I took strategy to buy a bunch of different types, but magnets and do some testing.
After one evening spent with prototype board, magnets, oscillosope and sensors I got an answer.

**I will use 2 bipolar hall sensors with 12 magnets mounted with alternating polarity** (the same resolution can be achieved by use of 6 magnets and 2 unipolar sensors, but then sensor failure detection is impossible).

Connections can be seen of following diagram. 10k pull-up resistor are mostly for testin purposes (tuning position of sensors), but can stay in place in final circuit also.

In practice I used an univesal board to make a circuit.

## Software support

Fortunately support for encoder is embedded in STM32F4 timers and even more support is given by VESC system itself, so setting up this whole thing takes only a minute.

I connected "encoder" outputs to pins to STM32 Pins B6 and B7, external pullup is already on board so there is no need for setting up internal pullups.
My implementation can be found in file **[app_pas_encoder.c](https://github.com/strzaleczka/bldc/blob/friction_drive/applications/app_pas_encoder.c)**


Initialization takes only a couple of lines:
``` c
#define ENCODER_RELOAD_VALUE        1000

void app_pas_encoder_init(void)
{
...
    encoder_init_abi(ENCODER_RELOAD_VALUE);
...
}
```


After that value interesting for us can be read from timer CNT register

``` c
uint32_t encoder_position = HW_ENC_TIM->CNT;
```



Main cyclist pedal movement is determined in function **calculate_action_from_position**. That function is called every 10ms from task and containes state machine to preserve previous state. It also makes some simple averaging and sends signal to listeners (by use of events) about full turn back detection (further it will be used for arming and disarming the controller). I think there is no point to write more about it, small diagram and code in c should explain everything clearly.

``` c
static void calculate_action_from_position(uint32_t encoder_position){
    static uint32_t previous_encoder_position = 0U;    
    static mov_type_enum previous_state = MOV_TYPE_NO_MOVE_OR_TOO_SLOW;
    static uint32_t backward_turn_detection_start_position = 0U;
    static bool turn_back_detected = false;
    
    position_delta = (float) calculate_encoder_delta(previous_encoder_position, encoder_position);
    angle_delta = ((float)position_delta/(float)FULL_CIRCLE_ENCODER_STEPS)*360.0f;
    speed = (angle_delta * 1000.0f)/ (float)THREAD_SLEEP_TIME;

    speed_running_avg = (speed_running_avg * (float)(SPEED_AVG_CONSTANT-1) + speed)/(float)SPEED_AVG_CONSTANT;

    switch(state)
    {
        case MOV_TYPE_NO_MOVE_OR_TOO_SLOW:
            if(speed_running_avg > MOV_FORWARD_SPEED_THR){
                state = MOV_TYPE_MOV_FORWARD;
            }
            else if(speed_running_avg < MOV_BACKWARD_SPEED_THR){
                state = MOV_TYPE_MOV_BACKWARD;
            }
            else{
                /*do nothing */
            }
            break;
        case MOV_TYPE_MOV_FORWARD:
            if(speed_running_avg < (MOV_FORWARD_SPEED_THR - MOV_SPEED_HYSTERESIS))
            {
                state = MOV_TYPE_NO_MOVE_OR_TOO_SLOW;
            }
            break;
        case MOV_TYPE_MOV_BACKWARD:
            if(speed_running_avg > (MOV_BACKWARD_SPEED_THR + MOV_SPEED_HYSTERESIS))
            {
                state = MOV_TYPE_NO_MOVE_OR_TOO_SLOW;
            }
            break;
        default:
            commands_printf("Something goes wrong");
            break;
    }

    if(state != previous_state)
    {
        commands_printf("State transition %s -> %s", 
            mov_state_type_to_string(previous_state), mov_state_type_to_string(state));
    }
    
    if(state == MOV_TYPE_MOV_BACKWARD)
    {
        if(previous_state != MOV_TYPE_MOV_BACKWARD)
        {
            backward_turn_detection_start_position = encoder_position;
        }

        if(turn_back_detected == false){
            if(calculate_encoder_delta(backward_turn_detection_start_position, encoder_position) < BACKWARD_MOVEMENT_TURN_THR)
            {
                send_event_about_turn_back();
                commands_printf("Turn back detected");
                turn_back_detected = true;
            }
        }       
    }
    else
    {
        turn_back_detected = false;
    }

    previous_encoder_position = encoder_position;
    previous_state = state;
}
```
